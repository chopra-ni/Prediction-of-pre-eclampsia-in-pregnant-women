Prediction of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women

The main aim of this project will be to predict if a pregnant woman will develop preeclampsia during and after her pregnancy and possibly predict the probability. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure has been normal. Left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to serious — even fatal — complications for both the mother and the baby. The most effective treatment for preeclampsia is the delivery of the baby. If preeclampsia is diagnosed too early in the pregnancy then it is a challenging task to deliver the baby as it needs more time to mature, but not delivering will put the mother at risk for serious and possible fatal complications. Preeclampsia can develop after the delivery of the baby, although rarely, the condition is known as postpartum preeclampsia.
